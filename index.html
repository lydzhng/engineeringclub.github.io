        <h2 class="about" ">About the RHHS Engineering Club</h2>
            <p>
              The Engineering Club is a group of students who are <br>
              interested in engineering technology and its application to the <br>
              real world. The club aims to encourage an active engagement in <br>
              the engineering field above and beyond the experience of the classroom. <br>
              Club members participate in solving problems, creating solutions for <br>
              everyday problems, and designing, planning and constructing different <br>
              projects. The club is open to all levels of students who are interested in <br> 
              science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).</p>
        
        <h2 class="do">What we do</h2>
            <p style="right:10px;"">
              High school engineering clubs provide an opportunity for students <br>
              to explore engineering and technology, and to enhance their skills in<br>
              problem-solving, teamwork, and cooperation. The clubs aim to improve <br>
              students' competitiveness for college applications and job resumes. <br>
              Students will have many opportunities to design, plan, and construct <br>
              different projects. These projects are usually completed in groups, <br>
              allowing students to work together and utilize their math and science <br>
              skills to solve real-world problems. Often, engineering clubs will <br>
              participate in competitions involving problem-solving and creativity. <br>
