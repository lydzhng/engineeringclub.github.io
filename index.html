        <h2 class="Blue" id="about">About the RHHS Engineering Club</h2>
            <p>The Engineering Club is a group of students who are interested in engineering technology 
              and its application to the real world. The club aims to encourage an active engagement in the engineering 
              field above and beyond the experience of the classroom.
              Club members participate in solving problems, creating solutions for everyday 
              problems, and designing, planning and constructing different projects. 
              The club is open to all levels of students who are interested in 
              science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).</p>
        <h2 class="Blue" id="do">What we do</h2>
            <p>High school engineering clubs provide an opportunity for 
              students to explore engineering and technology, and to enhance their skills in 
              problem-solving, teamwork, and cooperation. The clubs aim to improve students' 
              competitiveness for college applications and job resumes. Students will have many 
              opportunities to design, plan, and construct different projects. These projects are 
              usually completed in groups, allowing students to work together and utilize their math 
              and science skills to solve real-world problems. Often, engineering clubs will participate 
              in competitions involving problem-solving and creativity. Some competitions involve tasks 
              that test students' skills in building and designing structures.</p>
