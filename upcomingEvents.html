                <h2>SCIENCE OLYMPICS</h2>
                <p>The Engineering Club participates in the annual Science Olympics, <br>
                    which includes a variety of challenges from different science disciplines, <br>
                    including physics, engineering, biology, computer science, and math. <br>
                    The club works together in teams to participate in challenges and is awarded <br>
                    points based on their performance. The winners are announced at the end of the challenge.</p>

                <h2>SCHOOL EVENTS</h2>
                <p>Engineering club participates in many school events including the grade 9 <br>
                    club fair and the regular club fair. This year Engineering club hopes to <br>
                    be able to provide a year full of collaborations with other Richmond Hill <br>
                    high school clubs to include all aspects of science.

                <h2>EXTERNAL EVENTS</h2>
                <p>Participating in a cardboard boat race can be a fun and <br>
                    engaging experience for high school students. It provides <br>
                    an opportunity to combine teamwork with design and construction skills, <br> 
                    while also allowing students to showcase their creativity and technical <br>
                    skills. Additionally, it can help to increase workplace campaigns and raise <br>
                    awareness about the importance of working together. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Competing in the Wonderland Wondercoaster competition can provide similar benefits, <br>
                    as it also requires students to work as a team and use their creative and technical skills. <br> 
                    It can also be a great way for students to have fun and make new friends, while also learning <br>
                    about different areas of engineering.
